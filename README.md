### Network Traffic Insights using JSON and WireShark

This project started after I realized you could export packet information from WireShark as JSON.
I wanted to see if I could use the data to gain insights into the network traffic of my home network.
Ultimately, I realize I have a lot more to learn about networking, but I did learn *a lot* about JSON and JavaScript. :)
I plan to do a translation of this project into Python, but I wanted to get this out there for now. Doing a visualization
would be a great next step.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   npm
-   Node.js
-   A JSON file of packet data from WireShark
-   dotenv only if you want to use the https://api.ip2location.io API
-   WireShark (or any other packet sniffer)
